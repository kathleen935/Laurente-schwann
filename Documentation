n this project, I created a flower-shaped design using Python, combining coding concepts with visual graphics. The idea behind the project was to explore the intersection of art and programming, using Python to generate a flower shape that represents both the structure and beauty of code.

The flower was constructed by generating multiple petals around a central point. Each petal was created through mathematical calculations and repeated pattern creation, demonstrating how loops and geometry can come together to form a complex design.
